        <p>In this page, I have written some questions. Five of the questions pertain to me and my life. The last question is about something I have always been fascinated by and love sharing with others who might not think about the area we live in. Geology, climate change indicators in the oceans, and the intertidal zones' health are some of the things I like to keep up to date on.</p>
