        <h3>Did you answer these questions? They are the gatekeepers of this page...</h3>
        <ol><h4>
          <li>Have I ever broken a bone?</li>
            <p id='answer1'></p>
          <li>Have I ever been to Disneyland?</li>
            <p id='answer2'></p>
          <li>Have I ever lived in North Dakota?</li>
            <p id='answer3'></p>
          <li>How many years do you think I have lived in King county?</li>
            <p id='answer4'></p>
          <li>Did I meet my husband online?</li>
            <p id='answer5'></p>
          <li>How many volcanoes are there in Washington State?</li>
            <p id='answer6'></p>
        </ol></h4>
        <p>This is the page I have made. The questions are fun and don't count for anything but this assignment! I think that makes it more fun because there is less pressure and more focus on the actual code rather than "OH MY GAWD I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING COOL!!!" Going back to school 3 years after graduating from a 4 year degree followed by making little to no money leads to some actual outbursts like the hyperbolic example above. Enjoy!</p>
